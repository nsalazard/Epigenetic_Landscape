# Epigenetic Landscape

This project was developed during my 2024 internship at the **Université de Montréal**.  
The code is based on an older version of the repository created by Victoria Mochulska:  
**[victoria-mochulska/evoscape](https://github.com/victoria-mochulska/evoscape)**, a simulation framework for constructing and optimizing epigenetic landscape models.

##  Modifications 
During my internship, I extended and modified the original framework by adding several new features:

- Tilting the epigenetic landscape along different axes  
- Allowing the cells to start moving at different times
- Enhancing the fitness function by introducing:
  - weights  
  - penalties  
- Generating videos and GIFs that show the evolution of the landscape during the optimization process

These improvements were introduced to explore additional system dynamics and to make the framework more flexible, expressive, and useful for research applications.
